# Processbook programmeerproject Marijn Gulpen

## Day 1 (09-01-2016)
Made a proposal with all visualisations.

## Day 2 (10-01-2016)
I was sick and was not able to study.

## Day 3 (11-01-2016)
Collect the right data. For the interactive visualisations I chose to use data from the year 2007, 2010 and 2013. 
However it may be interesting to take years were switches has taken place (wealth of China or new laws that changed the CO2 emissions over years).
All data can be found in the folder *data*. 

I made the Design Product today and made some ideas for the JSON formats and different functions that I need to write.

To do for tomorrow:
* Make sure the right data is downloaded for visualisations 2, 3 and 4.
* Make all JSON files
* Make HTML files
