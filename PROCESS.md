# Processbook programmeerproject Marijn Gulpen

## Week 1

### Day 1 (09-01-2017)
Made a proposal with all visualisations.

### Day 2 (10-01-2017)
I was sick and was not able to study.

### Day 3 (11-01-2017)
Collect the right data. For the interactive visualisations I chose to use data from the year 2007, 2010 and 2013. 
However it may be interesting to take years were switches has taken place (wealth of China or new laws that changed the CO2 emissions over years).
All data can be found in the folder *data*. 

I made the Design Product today and made some ideas for the JSON formats and different functions that I need to write.

To do for tomorrow:
- [x] Make sure the right data is downloaded for visualisations 2, 3 and 4.
- [x] Make JSON file
- [X] Make HTML files

### Day 4 (12-01-2017)
I decided to make one big JSON file instead of two files. This is easy for visualisation 2 and 4. However, more attention need to be given to the dual line graph.
I also used all years (1960 till 2013) instead of 3 years. 

### Day 5 (13-01-2017)
Today I made my worldmap, which can only be used for 1 year. The code is now written for 2013.
I also made a linked piechart. It works, however it still needs te be prettier.
The timeslider is already in the HTML file, but not working yet

## Week 2

### Day 6 (16-01-2017)
** Finished for MVP **
* All three visualisations
* Timeslider
* Start of a table -> This is a new idea, which is the last interactive component of the visualisations. In this table you can look up a country and see its ranking of that particular year.

To do for today:
- [X] Timeslider [source](http://bl.ocks.org/zanarmstrong/ddff7cd0b1220bc68a58) of used timeslider

To do for tomorrow:
- [ ] Legend piechart
- [x] Start with the dual graph

### Day 7 (17-01-2016)
Today I made the third visualisation and linked it with the worldmap. 
So the timeslider, worldmap, piechart and linegraph are all working, but a little bit buggy and not pretty.

To do for tomorrow:
- [ ] Start with the table
